# Meshtastic

Meshtastic is a decentralized wireless off-grid mesh networking LoRa protocol. The main goal of the project is enabling low-power, long-range communication over unlicensed radio bands. It is designed around exchanging text messages and data in off-grid environments, with potential applications in IoT projects where a decentralized communication system is needed without existing infrastructure.
Meshtastic uses LoRa peer to peer (P2P), a long-range radio protocol, to form a mesh network by rebroadcasting messages to extend communication reach. Each device can connect with a single phone, enabling messaging in off-grid areas, making it useful for not only messages, but also data transmissions.


## Hardware

Meshtastic uses hardware development boards, like ESP32 and nRF52840, that support LoRa and BLE communication technologies, along with GNSS receivers. These devices enable seamless mobile app connectivity via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, allowing long-range message retransmission across a mesh network using LoRa transceivers. This setup is ideal for developing communicators that don't rely on conventional infrastructure.
Commercial purpose built Meshtastic boards and kits are available.
